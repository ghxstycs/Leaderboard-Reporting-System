**This Leaderboard system was originally created by NotHacking (discord user)**

# MUST READ!
Once you import you may receive an error about a namespace, open the "Leaderboard" script and at the top
you'll see "using MonkeyJumpers" and delete that.

# What changed from the original?
I've made adjustments to the reporting system and to the original Leaderboard, making it MUCH MUCH better, 
having improving the functions of the Leaderboard and fixing previous bugs from the old one.

# Package
The package is officially out! Simply import it, and have fun. Make sure to read, the README so you know how to work everything, and so banning can work correctly.
Make sure to take a look at everything.

# Version 1.0.0
- Release!
Content on release:
The actual two new scripts. The changed "ReportButton" script and 
revamped Leaderboard script. 

The next few updates may take a while depending on what people want added and etc. Let me know!
